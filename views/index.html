                <p class="title">Data Analytics firm Geolytix win Queen’s Award for Enterprise.</p>
                <br>
                <p>London-based Geolytix have today won a Queen’s Award for Enterprise for creating innovative spatial
                    algorithms that help retailers profitably attract and serve customers in a complex multi-channel
                    world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Despite the massive shift to online, physical stores (for now at least) remain the bedrock of commerce.
                    Where to open shops, and how their location and layout support the needs of both in-store and digital
                    customers, are questions that the world’s largest retailers are now tackling from a brand new
                    perspective.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Geolytix work with over 20 of the UK’s largest, most forward-thinking, retailers. We help them wisely
                    invest billions of pounds a year in real estate and technology. We use vast amounts of open data, and
                    our customer’s proprietary data. These data are used by Geolytix data scientists to create novel
                    algorithms that help businesses understand how and where consumers choose to shop in-store and
                    digitally. Our customers apply these algorithms to hypothetical futures involving new locations,
                    evolving customer demands and structural market changes. These predictions can then be used to direct
                    the huge capital investments required to develop new stores, new channels and new integrations of the
                    physical and digital shopping experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="quote">“We’re delighted to receive a Queen’s Award. We thank all our customers who have trusted us to help solve
                    their location and digital planning issues. We also thank the open data movement for releasing the
                    fabulous data that helps fuel these innovative solutions.”</p>

                <br>
                <p><strong>A</strong> – Less than 3,013 ft² (280 m²)</p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <p>Mid-sized grocer as defined by the CMA. Restricted Sunday hours, typically the large majority is food.</p>
                <br>
