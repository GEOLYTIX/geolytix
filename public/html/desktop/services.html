                <span>It’s never been more important for a retailer to understand how to optimise its store network. Whether you want to understand the potential number of stores you can open, how new formats will work together or how many stores you should close, given your growth in online sales, we can help.</span>

                <span>Our partners have all worked as Location Planners for major retailers. Over the years we have had experience in building models which solve key spatial business problems across the world, in the retail, banking, insurance and property industries. Whether you need to understand how much a new store will take, sales cannibalisation or how to optimise delivery routes to reduce road miles we can help.</span>

                <span>GEOLYTIX believe many businesses are missing a trick by not better combining their demographic, spatial and customer data. Whether it’s loyalty card, online or mobile data we would love the opportunity to help you drive out more insight and get the right mix of Bricks and Clicks. Omni-channel retailing is resulting in more knowledgeable customers and it’s vital you understand them.</span>

                <span>Spatial is different and so needs its own toolbox. GEOLYTIX understand when a simple scorecard will suffice, or when a business will benefit from a customised gravity model. We’ll help you make the right decision, dependent on your industry and accuracy objectives. And we understand businesses don’t just need a model. GEOLYTIX will work with you to create a framework that will improve your processes & management reporting.</span>
